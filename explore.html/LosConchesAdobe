<p> This location is known for its paranormal activity. It has appeared in paranormal television shows. Apparently used by gang members
<br>as a test for entrance or approval, new members are forced to sleep inside as a way to show toughness. Some people say that if you 
<br>sleep inside you will wake up outside. Screams and banging on floors has been heard. Apparitions of women are very common.
<br>Investigators have said that the dark presence is extremely strong and is common for it to follow you home.
